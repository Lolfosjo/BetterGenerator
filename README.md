##  BetterGenerator Alpha (Shit)

A PocketMine API 5 plugin that adds a so-called "Custom Generator" — written with truly awful, bug-ridden code that has absolutely nothing in common with the real Vanilla Minecraft 1.18 terrain generation.
(It’s also not supposed to have anything to do with the vanilla 1.18 generation)

Made with love and about 90% AI.

No license, no rules — do whatever you want! **(Only 1 Rule: Don´t sell it for money!)**

If you feel like fixing or continuing this mess, go ahead and make it yours.


## Features
- Plains, Oak Forest, Swamp, Spruce Peaks (Custom Biomes are easy to add)
- Relatively good looking mountains
- Easy creation of **unlimited** new biomes and more (BiomeRegistry.php)
- Old Caves (Are performance intensive and not very good, optional)
- Adds some Vanilla Blocks (Firefly Bush, Bush)
